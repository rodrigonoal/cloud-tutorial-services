# 01 Step One

Now we will connect our server to a mock REST API.
We will also take our first steps towards modularization.

### In addition to the prior steps, we will need:
- Another API for our service to communicate with
- A library to receive information from other APIs
- A HTTP client
- *Sugestion*: A tool to automatically restart the application during development

#### For this example we have:
- [The Cloud Tutorial Pal API](https://cloud-tutorial-pal.herokuapp.com/users)
- Axios (Py: Requests)
- Insomnia
- Nodemon

### This example shows:
- How to send GET/POST requests and receive information
- How to modularize an application (routes and controllers)
- How to use package JSON scripts

### Challenge: 
- Complete the CRUD Operations of the REST API
